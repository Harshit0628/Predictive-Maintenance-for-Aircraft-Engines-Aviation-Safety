# Predictive Maintenance of Aircraft Engines for Aviation Safety
Did a minor project on Predictive Maintenance for Aircraft Engines &amp; Aviation Safety for IBM.
## Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is a data-driven, proactive approach that aims to improve the reliability and safety of aircraft operations by forecasting potential failures and anomalies in aircraft components and engines. It can help airlines reduce maintenance costs, optimize resource allocation, and minimize downtime.
